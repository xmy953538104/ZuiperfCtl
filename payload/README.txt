Behavior:
- Refresh-rate baseline is a hard 120Hz lock.
- The app includes a minimal accessibility service for foreground-scene events.
  It does not retrieve window content or perform gestures; it only receives the
  foreground package name and immediately applies that scene's refresh rule.
- The root daemon consumes the accessibility scene channel for GPU/profile
  enforcement and only falls back to dumpsys polling when event updates are not
  available.
- Notification clicks optimistically lock peak/min/active refresh values from
  the app process before the daemon records the scene rule, avoiding a visible
  fallback to 120Hz while the daemon is still polling.
- The daemon re-checks peak_refresh_rate and min_refresh_rate even when the
  foreground scene has not changed, so ZUI drift is locked back to the learned
  scene value.
- SystemUI and ZuiperfCtl are treated as transient overlays. Notification clicks
  learn the most recent real foreground scene, so pulling the shade over a game
  records the game, not SystemUI or ZuiperfCtl.
- Choosing 120Hz removes the current scene's exception rule.
- If no scene target can be resolved, the click is ignored instead of creating a
  global manual override.
- Performance profiles are converted into ZuiPP XML by XmlProfileGenerator.
- CPU/GPU level IDs use 1-based lowIndex*100+highIndex inside each hardware type.
- Saving or deleting a performance profile regenerates the working XML files.
- Applying performance regenerates both XML files, bind mounts them through init,
  and restarts ZuiPP/game helper packages.
- If ZuiPP does not enforce a foreground profile's GPU range, the daemon also
  applies the same range to KGSL pwrlevel nodes and publishes the live GPU state.
- Leaving a profiled app restores both KGSL pwrlevel and devfreq min/max limits.
- AsoulOpt is not configured per app. The UI only reports service health and
  exports its log.
